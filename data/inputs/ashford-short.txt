MR SALTEENA was an elderly man of 42 and was fond
of asking peaple to stay with him.  He had quite a young
girl staying with him of 17 named Ethel Monticue.  Mr
Salteena had dark short hair and mustache and wiskers
which were very black and twisty.  He was middle sized
and he had very pale blue eyes.  He had a pale brown
suit but on Sundays he had a black one and he had a topper
every day as he thorght it more becoming.  Ethel Monticue
had fair hair done on the top and blue eyes.  She had
a blue velvit frock which had grown rarther short in the
sleeves.  She had a black straw hat and kid gloves.
  One morning Mr Salteena came down to brekfast and
found Ethel had come down first which was strange.  Is
the tea made Ethel he said rubbing his hands.  Yes said
Ethel and such a quear shaped parcel has come for you.
Yes indeed it was a quear shape parcel it was a hat box tied
down very tight and a letter stuffed between the string.
Well well said Mr Salteena parcels do turn quear I will
read the letter first and so saying he tore open the letter
and this is what it said

  MY DEAR ALFRED.
    I want you to come for a stop with me so I have sent
you a top hat wraped up in tishu paper inside the box.
Will you wear it staying with me because it is very
uncommon. Please bring one of your young ladies
whichever is the prettiest in the face.
    I remain Yours truely
    BERNARD CLARK.

  Well said Mr Salteena I shall take you to stay Ethel and
fancy him sending me a top hat. Then Mr S. opened the
box and there lay the most splendid top hat of a lovly
rich tone rarther like grapes with a ribbon round compleat.
  Well said Mr Salteena peevishly I dont know if I shall
like it the bow of the ribbon is too flighty for my age.
Then he sat down and eat the egg which Ethel had so
kindly laid for him. After he had finished his meal he
got down and began to write to Bernard Clark he ran up
stairs on his fat legs and took out his blotter with a loud
sniff and this is what he wrote

  MY DEAR BERNARD

myself with you.I am fond of digging in the garden and
